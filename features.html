                <h2>Real-time Tyre Pressure Monitoring</h2>
                <p>Real-time tyre pressure monitoring allows continuous tracking of tyre pressure levels while vehicles are in operation. This is achieved by integrating pressure sensors into the tyres, which send data wirelessly to a central system or mobile app via IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things).</p>

                <h2>Load Monitoring</h2>
                <p>Load monitoring helps track the weight being carried by the dumper in real-time. Overloading dumpers can cause excessive wear on tyres, which reduces their lifespan and increases the likelihood of tyre failure.</p>

        <div class="feature-container">
            <div class="feature-description">
                <h2>Live Location Tracking</h2>
                <p>Live location tracking provides real-time positioning of the dumpers via GPS integration. This feature is essential for logistics and operations management, especially in large mining areas.</p>

            <div class="feature-description">
                <h2>Temperature and Wear Condition Monitoring</h2>
                <p>Monitoring the temperature and wear conditions of tyres is essential for maintaining their health and preventing failures. High temperatures in tyres can lead to blowouts.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="feature-container">
            <div class="feature-description">
                <h2>Automated Alerts for Potential Issues</h2>
                <p>Automated alerts are a core component of the Tyre Guard system, enhancing preventive maintenance and safety. These alerts enable proactive decision-making.</p>
            </div>
